# Capstone Project

This is my first Capstone Project.

This is a general page that can be used to sell courses, festivals, bootcamps, among other things.
It has a double header to navigate between website login pages and website content pages.

Only the Home and About pages were created.

You can have a look at them through this link: https://leonardodiasb.github.io/Capstone-1-Course-Page/
